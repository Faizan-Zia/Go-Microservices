# Go-Microservices

Inspired by Nic-Jackson's series, [Introduction to Microservices](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmD8u-IFdreyh6EUfevBcbiuCKzFk0EW_), practicing building microservices from scratch in golang. The idea is simple, follow the Introduction to Microservices playlist, learn the stuff and enhance the services by exploring the tooling further.
